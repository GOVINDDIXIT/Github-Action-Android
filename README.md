## Fastlane

Fastlane is a tool to automate any tedious tasks in building, testing and deploying mobile applications. In this template, the fastlane template is set up to run specific gradle commands locally and on the GitHub Actions continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

To get started with fastlane, refer to the [Fastlane Summary](docs/fastlane.md).

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows the creation of custom workflows within the GitHub repository. These custom workflows can automate specific tasks within GitHub and build out a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. With this template, the CI pipeline is set up to validate new changes on pull requests to the master branch.

To get started with GitHub Actions, refer to the [GitHub Actions Summary](docs/github-actions.md).

## Templates

Creating issues and pull requests are common practices when working on a project. The creation of issues and pull requests comes with a pre-set template to ensure all of the required information are captured in the correct manner. The templates for issues and pull request can be found in the .github folder.
